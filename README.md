# Rosetta Code runners

[Rosetta Code](http://www.rosettacode.org/) is a programming website that shares implementations of many kinds of programming tasks using many different programming languages.

This repo has some Rosetta Code samples and some similar kinds of samples that we've gathered and written. We have organized this repo to be friendly to code runners, e.g. each task implementation is in its own folder ready to compile and/or run.
